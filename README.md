# Basic Lighting Calculation Tool

This is a web-based lighting calculator that uses the Lumen Method to estimate lighting requirements for a room.  
It includes two main functions:

- **Total Luminaires Needed**  
- **Achieved Lux Level**

The tool also provides:
- Room index calculation  
- Utilization factor (UF) estimation  
- Layout generation (Grid / Staggered)  
- Preset values for common room types  
- Automatic validation and error checking  
- Dialux multiplier (1.097) included for accuracy
